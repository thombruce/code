tools I might like to employ is charts. I've worked with charts before using a number of different libraries. My favourite, simply because it appears to be the most powerful and flexible, is [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). Unfortunately, because it is so powerful and flexible, it is not easy to drop in and use straight away - I would need to do a lot of custom configuration. So, as a simpler measure for the time being, I've opted to install the beautiful little [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```sh\nyarn add vue-chartjs chart.js@2.9.4\n```\n\n**Component:**\n\n```vue[BarChart.vue]\n<script>\nimport { Bar } from 'vue-chartjs'\n\nexport default {\n  extends: Bar,\n  props: [\n    'labels',\n    'datasets'\n  ],\n  mounted () {\n    this.renderChart({\n      labels: this.labels,\n      datasets: this.datasets\n    })\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```md\n<bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></bar-chart>\n```\n\nThat's a simple, drop-in and start using solution to a problem I don't need to give a lot of consideration just yet.\n\nThe library is lacking in some advanced features, but many of these can be added through plugins - I'm just not really sure how to go about that using the Vue package yet. I also think I could clean up the manner in which I pass data to the component - it could be simplified, more intuitive. Chart.js may need the data in this format, but I can simplify the props required for end users; one big thing I may add is a series of default colours that are selected automatically. But for now, this will do.\n\nUsing this library, I now have access to the following charts, and could expand a little on this list in the future:\n\n<div class='flex flex-wrap'>\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Bar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-bar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Horizontal Bar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-horizontal-bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-horizontal-bar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Line Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-line-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, fill: true, data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-line-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Pie Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-pie-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderWidth: 0, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-pie-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Doughnut Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-doughnut-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderWidth: 0, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-doughnut-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Polar Area Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-polar-area-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: [`rgba(239, 67, 68, 1)`, `rgba(39, 185, 129, 1)`, `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`], backgroundColor: [`rgba(239, 67, 68, .25)`, `rgba(39, 185, 129, .25)`, `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-polar-area-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Radar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-radar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-radar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Scatter Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-scatter-chart :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: `#EF4444`, data: [{ x: 20, y: 30 }, { x: 40, y: 10 }] }, { label: `Data2`, backgroundColor: `#3B82F6`, data: [{ x: 35, y: 15 }] }]'></playfair-scatter-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Bubble Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-bubble-chart :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(239, 67, 68, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(239, 67, 68, .25)`, data: [{ x: 20, y: 30, r: 20 }, { x: 40, y: 10, r: 10 }] }, { label: `Data2`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, data: [{ x: 35, y: 15, r: 50 }] }]'></playfair-bubble-chart>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n_Update (2021-05-28): I've now packaged these charts into my own custom library, [Vue Playfair](https://github.com/thombruce/vue-playfair)._","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/charting-it-out","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-09-02T23:23:02.083Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1630625104488},"$loki":3},{"slug":"doing-things-with-markdown","description":"Exploring and extending Markdown's capabilities","title":"Doing Things with Markdown","authors":["Thom Bruce"],"date":"2021-05-20T14:05:39.000Z","categories":["Jamstack"],"series":["Getting Started"],"tags":["Blogging","Nuxt.js","Markdown"],"toc":[{"id":"typography","depth":2,"text":"Typography"},{"id":"inline-code--code-blocks","depth":2,"text":"Inline Code & Code Blocks"},{"id":"images","depth":2,"text":"Images"},{"id":"tables","depth":2,"text":"Tables"},{"id":"nuxt-components","depth":2,"text":"Nuxt Components"},{"id":"markdown-extensions","depth":2,"text":"Markdown Extensions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"UPDATE: This blog post was originally written at ThomBruce.com, before I decided to separate and dedicate specific domains to singular subjects (code in this case).

Some of the markup below is broken as a result. For instance, I do not know if I have use for KaTeX outside of this blog post so I have not installed it._\n\nI want to go over again what's possible with Markdown; in particular what is possible with Nuxt's markdown parser which I've learned is slightly extended, and what I would like to add myself.\n\n## Typography\n\nI've mentioned [elsewhere](/blog/no-going-back) what _is_ and _isn't_ possible in **Markdown** natively in terms of typography, and what can be achieved using HTML instead. Just to recover it here, this short paragraph has made use of a title, a link, italic and bold text. It was written like this:\n\n```md\n## Typography\n\nI've mentioned [elsewhere](/blog/no-going-back) what _is_ and _isn't_ possible in **Markdown** natively in terms of typography, and what can be achieved using HTML instead. Just to recover it here, this short paragraph has made use of a title, a link, italic and bold text. It was written like this:\n```\n\n## Inline Code & Code Blocks\n\nLet's cover code blocks quickly since I've just shown one off. There are a few ways to write these in Markdown, but most commonly used are the three back-ticks, like so: `` ``` ``. These are placed above and below the block of code we want to enclose. The top set also accepts a language argument: `` ```js ``. Nuxt's parser extends the standard with support for a file-name attribute too: `` ```js[myFile.js] ``. Putting all of that together, we get a code block:\n\n```js[myFile.js]\nimport otherFile from './otherFile.js'\n\nexport default {\n  hello: 'world',\n}\n```\n\n## Images\n\nI've already partially discussed ways to include images in Markdown [here](/blog/images-and-nuxt). I'm still, for the time being, using the Nuxt Image component for the benefits that offers.\n\n## Tables\n\nHere's a table I've just copied over from [another page](code/thom-bruce-com):\n\n| Domain | DNS | Framework | Source | Hosting | CI/CD | Status | Content API | CMS | CDN | Comments |\n| --- | ---|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) | [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) | [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Upptime](https://status.thombruce.com/) | Static | File System | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)\n\nThe Markdown for that looks like this:\n\n```md\n| Domain | DNS | Framework | Source | Hosting | CI/CD | Status | Content API | CMS | CDN | Comments |\n| --- | ---|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) | [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) | [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Upptime](https://status.thombruce.com/) | Static | File System | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)\n```\n\nI haven't done much to style it besides ensuring that it remains readable with overflow scrolling.\n\n## Nuxt Components\n\nNot native to Markdown, Nuxt has support for dropping in components, like this Media Card I made:\n\n<!-- WONTFIX: <media-card item='/media/movies/spider-man-no-way-home'></media-card> -->\n\n```md\n<media-card item='/media/movies/spider-man-no-way-home'></media-card>\n```\n\nThere's nothing more to it than that. I just create and modify the Media Card component as part of my code, and if I change it then the changes will be automatically applied here too. I can drop in other components too, like a map:\n\n<!-- WONTFIX: <map-view place='carlisle'></map-view> -->\n\n```md\n<map-view place='carlisle'></map-view>\n```\n\nThey could get a little verbose if I wanted to do something particularly complicated, but with drop-in components like these it's possible to add absolutely anything I want to a Markdown document.\n\n## Markdown Extensions\n\nThere's at least one other Markdown extension active by default. That is checklists like this one:\n\n- [x] One\n- [x] Two\n- [ ] Three\n\n```md\n- [x] One\n- [x] Two\n- [ ] Three\n```\n\nThat can come in pretty useful.\n\nAs well as this, I need to make note that Nuxt uses Remark under the hood which, along with Rehype, supports adding additional plugins. It's documented in Nuxt Content [here](https://content.nuxtjs.org/configuration#markdown).\n\nOne plugin I am eager to install (so will do right now) is the [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math) plugin. To install, it seems I need to `yarn add remark-math rehype-katex` and then modify nuxt.config.js like so:\n\n```js[nuxt.config.js]\n  content: {\n    markdown: {\n      remarkPlugins: [\n        'remark-math'\n      ],\n      rehypePlugins: [\n        'rehype-katex'\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nAfter which, I should be able to add inline math ($N$) as well as math blocks like this one:\n\n$$\nN = R_* \\cdot f_\\mathrm{p} \\cdot n_\\mathrm{e} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{l} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{i} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{c} \\cdot L\n$$\n\nHow much use I'll get out of that, I don't know. I've considered getting back into mathematics a little bit, so we'll see.","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/doing-things-with-markdown","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-09-02T23:23:02.083Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T23:23:02.083Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1630625104550},"$loki":4},{"slug":"github-v-gitlab-lfs","description":"My choice of a Git remote.","title":"GitHub Vs.

I don't actually know how many years, I have been trying to pursue a certain ideal of _Convention over Configuration_. This is the web development philosophy that advocates for having a sort of set of best practices that are repeatable, reproducible, and that emphasise essentially... lazy programming. I am a lazy programmer. It's a good thing, actually. The thing about lazy programmers is not that we're \"lazy\" in the classical sense. We actually work very hard in the present in order to reduce work in the future thanks to having a set of reproducible tools, packages and practises. _Conventions_, that is, that simply drop-in and require little to know _configuration_. As I say, I've been at this for I don't know how many years so it's an ideal that's always changing, my conventions are always evolving. Lately I've been pursuing this on the [Jamstack](/categories/jamstack), and in particular in Nuxt.js.\n\nBefore I divert to far off the course here, the reason I'm writing this blog post is to explore - step by step - the conventions I've now established for myself as a Nuxt.js developer. I want to do that by detailing below the process as I actually put another site live, from scratch. So I'm going to start with no website, and by the end of this article have a brand new website live on the internet. It won't take very long, because I'm very confident in these conventions I've established. Along the way, I may add a little commentary about improving this process or about where I want to change things in the future. Okay, let's begin. The website I'm going to be building is just called 'Screenplays', and it is essentially just a blogging website like this one, except that it will be built to specifically host some screenplays I wrote back in university. Here we go...\n\n## Creating the Project\n\nFirst up, I'm running what has become a standard for creating Nuxt apps. `yarn create` accepts a template argument - `nuxt-app` in this case - and a name for the project which is going to be `screenplays`.\n\n```sh\nyarn create nuxt-app screenplays\n```\n\nThis runs an interactive process, meaning it will ask me a few questions about the setup and what features I desire:\n\n```sh\nProject name: screenplays\nProgramming language: JavaScript\nPackage manager: Yarn\nUI Framework: None\nNuxt.js modules: Axios, Progressive Web App, Content\nLinting tools: None\nTesting framework: None\nRendering mode: Universal\nDeployment target: Static\nDevelopment tools: jsconfig.json, Dependabot\nVersion control system: Git\n```\n\nKey to my setup, I've selected no UI framework, the universal rendering mode and the static deployment target.\n\nThe universal rendering mode essentially says \"this Nuxt app should be built as if it is to be rendered by a server\", but that's not actually the case (I'm oversimplifying); the static deployment target effectively adds to that \"and the server rendering it is the build process\". The result of those arguments is that this builds and generates a \"static site\", which is a set of HTML files not actually requiring a server to deploy for public visitation.\n\nThe reason I've selected no UI framework isn't actually because none of them interest me - in fact, one of the listed options is Tailwind CSS, which I will be using - but that I've configured everything I would like from a UI framework in a package of my own that I will install momentarily.\n\n## Style and Structure\n\nThe default Nuxt template, even without a style framework, comes with some pages and components that I'll just want to delete. These are:\n\n- components/Logo.vue\n- content/hello.md\n- layouts/default.vue\n- pages/index.vue\n\n_I should delete or replace some stuff in the static directory too, but this is a process in progress._\n\nNext, I'll add my own package, TNT (it doesn't really stand for anything but is derived from the idea that it's _Thom's Nuxt Template_):\n\n```sh\nyarn add https://github.com/thombruce/nuxt-tnt --dev\n```\n\nAnd I'll install the module by registering it as a buildModule in nuxt.config.js:\n\n```js[nuxt.config.js]\nbuildModules: [\n  '@thombruce/nuxt-tnt'\n],\n```\n\nThis installs some custom components, all registered and globally available, it installs Tailwind CSS with a default configuration setup to my liking, it even registers a couple of custom layouts (which is why I was able to delete the default layout above). The one thing it does not install that I wish it did is a set of default pages. This isn't currently possible in Nuxt, but should be in Nuxt version 3 which is currently in active development.\n\nSo, rather than write my own pages, I copy them across from one of my existing projects. In this case, I've copied them from this website into my project. They're specifically designed to be reusable like this. By default they are:\n\n```\npages\n├── _taxonomy\n│   └── _term.vue\n├── blog\n│   ├── _slug.vue\n│   └── index.vue\n├── _page.vue\n└── index.vue\n```\n`_page` and `_taxonomy` are pretty special. `_page` is polymorphic and will act like page with a dynamic slug at the root of the site _or_ as a taxonomy index; the taxonomy slug can also be dynamic. This saves me having to create very similar pages for tags, categories, series... that kind of thing. In the case of my screenplays project, I don't actually want the blog pages, so I'll rename that directory to 'screenplays' and replace the two occurrences of the word 'blog' in those files with that as well. Those two occurrences actually pertain to the content directory, so with that change made...\n\n## Adding My Content\n\nLike I said, this is a site for some screenplays I wrote back in university. Back then I used Final Draft and Celtx, two leading script writing platforms with proprietary formats where that format is also... binary. But I've converted all of them to the open source Fountain format more recently, which is a text file format like Markdown (based on Markdown in fact). I've also written another package specifically for handling that file format in Nuxt Content, so I'm just going to copy those files into `content/screenplays` and install my `vue-fountain` package:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @thombruce/vue-fountain --dev\n```\n\n```js[nuxt.config.js]\nbuildModules: [\n  '@thombruce/nuxt-tnt',\n  '@thombruce/vue-fountain/nuxt'\n],\n```\n\nThis is an extra step I wouldn't normally have to take if it were a standard, markdown-based static blogging site, but it is a step I do take here for my screenplays. But in fact... that's it.\n\nNow having those content files in place, I can navigate to them when I boot up the dev site with `yarn dev`. Those pages are generated and exist. If it were a more straightforward blogging site, I'd just create Markdown files and be rolling.\n\nThis site is ready to deploy!\n\n## Ready for Launch!\n\nI could at this point simply run `yarn generate`, which would build my website and put all of the files I need into a `dist` folder. Then I could drag and drop that directory into a hosting service like Netlify.com and _just like that_ my site would be live. But I want a couple of extra things. In consideration of hosting a website, I want:\n\n- Source control\n- Continuous integration\n- Hosting\n\nThe hosting part we've just discussed. I will in fact be using Netlify, but I won't be dragging and dropping the dist folder into their deploy window. In order to achieve the criteria of a source controlled site with continuous integration, I'll also be using GitHub and GitHub Actions. Those familiar with Netlify might ask, _why GitHub Actions instead of Netlify's automated deployments?_ A fair question. I would in fact prefer to use Netlify's automated deployments, because their service is fantastic, but I want to benefit from GitHub's unlimited free build minutes for open source projects.\n\nTo achieve this, I need a GitHub Actions Workflow for which I again have a standard template that I'll copy and paste:\n\n```yml[.github/workflows/deploy.yml]\nname: deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest]\n        node: [14]\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      # https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/165#issuecomment-657673315\n      - name: Create LFS file list\n        run: git lfs ls-files -l | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort > .lfs-assets-id\n      - name: Restore LFS cache\n        uses: actions/cache@v2\n        id: lfs-cache\n        with:\n          path: .git/lfs\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-lfs-${{ hashFiles('.lfs-assets-id') }}-v1\n      - name: Git LFS Pull\n        run: git lfs pull\n\n      - name: Setup node env\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: yarn\n\n      - name: Generate\n        run: yarn run generate\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          publish_branch: dist\n          publish_dir: ./dist\n```\n\nNow, when I push to GitHub, this workflow will build the site and commit the result to a separate branch called `dist`.\n\nAt this point I can create a new repository on GitHub and:\n\n```sh\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Ready to launch!\"\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/thombruce/screenplays.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nWhen the workflow is complete, I can create a new site on Netlify linked to the repo and publish straight from the `dist` branch.\n\nDone!\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nOkay, so if I weren't also typing this up this process would have taken me what... about twenty minutes? No more, certainly. That's largely thanks to having so much of my personal configuration written into my TNT module for reuse. There are some problems and some things I left out. For instance... I've also had to add a `tnt.config.js` file and slightly modify `nuxt.config.js` to import it; ideally TNT would handle that import itself, and even more ideally it would have some fallback configuration that would be used if the file didn't exist. That's a chore for me yet to take on, but shouldn't be too tricky, hence I left it out of my write-up because I don't know that it will remain relevant for long. I've also had to do some other specific customisations that were specific to this site handling screenplays; those aren't typically relevant to a site build, so I omitted them. I also still need to install Git LFS - something I typically do to handle things like image files - and do some of my own style customisations for the site, mainly by adding a `tailwind.config.js` file and modifying some configuration there.\n\nAs I mentioned when copying across page templates, a Nuxt module like TNT cannot currently offer a set of custom pages but this is supposed to become possible with Nuxt 3. Strictly it is achievable by injecting some custom routes... but this doesn't result with an easily overwritable behaviour. That's one of the perks of TNT - any of its components can be overwritten simply by creating your own component existing at the same path in your project directory. I want that for pages too, and so I'm eagerly awaiting Nuxt 3 at which point I think I'll be able to \"finish\" TNT to my liking and maybe make it more useful to others too.\n\nIn less than the time it took me to write those two paragraphs of wrapping up, my GitHub workflow was complete so I have:\n\n1. Created a site on Netlify from the `dist` branch of my GitHub repo\n2. Added a custom domain to my DNS records pointing at that site\n\nThis took less than a minute. It'll take a little longer for the DNS to propagate and for Netlify to provision an SSL certificate, though this is typically pretty quick too. By the time anyone reads this, the site should be available at [ink.thombruce.com](https://ink.thombruce.com/).\n\nThat's a basic blogging website done in under twenty minutes. The template has a minimalist kinda style which I still need to work on (I'm more developer than designer), and there are some other kinks to work out yet too, but that's... that's it. I have this process down to a tee.

Markdown has this baked-in with syntax that looks a little like this: `![](/path-to-image.jpg)`. Nuxt too could immediately support this syntax if I simply placed images into its `/static` directory, but... this approach wouldn't support image processing by default. The images would be loaded at their native size, regardless of the context they're being displayed in - whether that be on a mobile phone or a large desktop screen. The result would be some unnecessarily large files being loaded for mobile, and little in the way of control of the image content elsewhere.\n\nOne alternative is to use the HTML `<picture>` tag, which has support for loading different sources for different screens. This gives us significantly more control, but would result in some pretty cumbersome tags in our markdown content. Plus, images would need to be processed manually and we might end up storing numerous versions of our image at different sizes. I would prefer to save just one image, from which different sizes could be generated automatically.\n\nFortunately, there's the relatively new plugin, [Nuxt Image](https://image.nuxtjs.org/). Nuxt Image adds image processing to Nuxt, so that I don't have to fret too much about manually handling those things.\n\nI have to do a couple of things to add it to my project. First:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev @nuxt/image\n```\n\nThis adds the Nuxt Image plugin to my Nuxt website. But I also need to add it to my build modules, so that Nuxt acknowledges it as something I want to use when building my site from the source code. In `nuxt.config.js`, I add:\n\n```js\nbuildModules: [\n  '@nuxt/image',\n]\n```\n\nWith that done, I can now use Nuxt's `NuxtImg` and `NuxtPicture` tags wherever I like, including in my Markdown content. And with that, I can control the sizes displayed across different devices. Take note of the `sizes` attributes used below. Here, I've set it to the same value for sm, md and lg (small, medium and large screens), but these can be set individually so that different screens load different sizes. `50vw` and `25vw` below mean \"50% of the view width\" and \"25% of the view width\" respectively, so Nuxt actually will create differently sized images for differently sized screens, even though the values are the same. `vw` could have been `px` instead, which would have meant these were explicit pixel values, rather than sizes relative to screen size.\n\nWhat all of this means is that I can now use the `nuxt-img` tag to generate images at different sizes; not merely the same image displayed at different sizes, but separate images specifically generated for the size that they will appear.\n\n_Note: It is sort of poor practice to load the same image twice; if I want it twice, why not just load it once at the larger of the two values and artificially shrink the second version? The two examples below are included only for demonstration purposes._\n\n### An image at 50vw\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nHow it looks:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw'></nuxt-img>\n\n### The same image at 25vw\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:25vw md:25vw lg:25vw'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nHow it looks:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:25vw md:25vw lg:25vw'></nuxt-img>\n\nAs stated in the note above, it's a little redundant to load the same image twice here at two separate sizes. An alternative to loading the second image would be to do the following:\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw' style='width:25vw;'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nInstead of loading a separate, smaller version of the image, this would load the same version as the initial tag. The size as displayed is then controlled by CSS in the `style` attribute instead.\n\nThe result looks much the same:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/code.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw' style='width:25vw;'></nuxt-img>\n\nThe aim of course is always to only load precisely what is needed, and no more.\n\nAs a next step, I would really love to tap into the Markdown parser and override its image handling so that I could use `![](/path-to-image.jpg)` syntax and achieve the same result.

I'm very interested in Fedora... and whatever GNOME is, though I think that might be on Ubuntu too???\n\nOS: Ubuntu vs Fedora - Consider other options.\n\nDesktop Environment: GNOME - Looks like both Ubuntu and Fedora use this. Also OpenSUSE, though it isn't an OS I've yet looked at - seems too plain for my liking.\n\nThen it's a question of how software is installed...\n\nOn MacOS, I use Homebrew with the `brew install` command - on Ubuntu it would be `apt`, on Fedora `yum`. Both, I think, can install Snap if we want that... I think it's kinda like Linux's app store??? I rarely use Apple's - not sure I'd use Linux's, although... it does have advantages, apparently like app isolation: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/a364ii/proscons_of_snap_vs_apt/\n\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/looking-towards-a-linux-future","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-09-02T23:23:02.083Z","updatedAt":"2021-09-02T23:23:02.083Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1630625104705},"$loki":9},{"slug":"my-first-nuxt-module","description":"My first Vue plugin that integrates seamlessly as a Nuxt module.","title":"My First Nuxt Module","authors":["Thom Bruce"],"date":"2021-05-23T01:06:56.000Z","categories":["Jamstack"],"series":["Getting Started"],"tags":["Vue.js","Nuxt.js"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In putting my blog together, and porting some old code to this new ecosystem, I began to create a... well not overly but still a bit of a cluttered project.

I could push that up to the NPM package registry, install it in my Nuxt project and manually `import` my components as one might in a standard Vue project.

My hope was to use Nuxt so that I could benefit from my [TNT](https://thombruce.github.io/tnt) package, but I think that's a non-starter. It will be easier to integrate a more barebones Vue application into my Ruby on Rails app than a Nuxt one. I will revisit TNT and see if I can make it Vue-compatible too, because I don't want to lose the features I've worked hard on there. But first, the frontend UI application. Let's get started...\n\n```sh\nvue create dynamite-ui\n```\n\nThis starts an interactive menu, and I'm going to manually select the features I want. We'll leave the defaults in place: `Babel` and `Linter / Formatter`. But I'll also select `Progressive Web App (PWA) Support`, `Router` and `Vuex` since I know I typically want these a ways down the line. We'll avoid `Typescript`, `CSS Pre-processors` and the testing options for the time being. I'll be using TailwindCSS, which works with PostCSS and this is always active by default I think. As for testing... I just can't decide between `Mocha + Chai` and `Jest`. I'm leaning towards `Jest` but we'll consider it a bit later.\n\nIn the next step, we'll say `Y`es to history mode.\n\nWe're going to go with `ESLint + Standard Config` because I like Standard JS a lot.\n\nWe'll `Lint on save` and use dedicated config files. And sure, we'll save this as a preset; call it... 'Barebones UI'.\n\nOkay, so that generates the project.

That sentence above might render something like this in the end:\n\n```html\n<span>That doesn't actually mean I can't do things like add titles and <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic text</em>.</span>\n```\n\nIf you use a CMS like WordPress, or if you're writing a document in Microsoft Word, there is a certain magical step that gets hidden. You write rich text, you see the **bolds** and the _italics_, but how it renders to a website is hidden from you. As a developer, I like to know that I have total control. I can use HTML to add <span style=\"color:red;\">c</span><span style=\"color:orange;\">o</span><span style=\"color:yellow;\">l</span><span style=\"color:green;\">o</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">u</span><span style=\"color:violet;\">r</span>, but HTML can be a little overly verbose as in the example above and... well, here's the HTML required to render those colours just now:\n\n```html\n<span style=\"color:red;\">c</span><span style=\"color:orange;\">o</span><span style=\"color:yellow;\">l</span><span style=\"color:green;\">o</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">u</span><span style=\"color:violet;\">r</span>\n```\n\nI prefer cleaner markup, not having to type out quite so much, but I like having that control. So Markdown is great for that. It is a superset of HTML, meaning I can include HTML (as I did to produce that colour effect), but for the most part I can write clean and simple, but still _dynamic_ text that remains easy to read.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I today prefer things like Static Site Generators over the server-dependent systems like WordPress, Joomla and Ruby on Rails. Strictly, I could write Markdown in any of those systems too, but there are other benefits to Static Site Generators. They don't depend on a server, so the websites they produce are highly dependable. They skip the step where the server _figures out_ how to render the HTML; by the time a user is visiting a website produced by a Static Site Generator, the HTML is ready to deliver, so they're also blazing fast and much less fault-prone. But they can still do fancy, programmatic stuff like... for example, converting Markdown to HTML, they just do it earlier than at runtime. The trade-off, you see, is that publishing isn't quite instantaneous as it might be on a server-supported website. You could never have a chat app, for instance, that used an SSG to communicate chat messages, because every new message would mean having to build the HTML and republish the website again; it would be too slow. For something like a blog though, or for documentation or informational websites, this trade-off is worth it for the gains. So what if publishing a new page takes a minute instead of a microsecond, we've saved a lot more time for every visitor to the website, and a lot of energy in terms of rendering HTML on a server.\n\nStatic sites won't replace everything, obviously, but we can still integrate dynamic features into static pages. This is why I've chosen [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as my generator of choice; it's a very flexible JavaScript framework for developing sophisticated applications... that just so happens to also have static site generation built in. So... _kind of_ best of both worlds. Still might need a server to facilitate certain things, but it's a strong foundational start.\n\nSo, this is my new blog. And... who knows? Maybe in the future I will decide I need to move it elsewhere, but... I really want to try to remember this time, _No Going Back_. If I move, I can take these blog posts, these markdown files with me. If I need to host the content on a server instead, I can write code that uploads them for me. Heck, I could have written scripts that exported from WordPress or Rails and gave me a zipped up folder of Markdown files, but my old blogs are lost to time now, I think. I've just got to not let that happen again.\n\nI don't know what you'll be seeing from me here, yet, but I will update as I go along and have anything worthwhile to say.

It's getting updated all the time as I add more to my static websites and produce others. Speaking of which...\n\n## My Static Websites\n\nI actually started TNT to collect my conventions as I worked on these. I currently have eight static websites deployed that use TNT. They are:\n\n1.

And _Marmalade_.... _Marmalade_ is an old project I'm still very interested in revisiting; it would be a personal and business management dashboard, integrating much of what you might need to keep both aspects of your life, businesses and brands in order. All of these require backends that either store critical data, or communicate with third party services securely. And for that... for the past ten years... for that I've used Ruby.\n\n### Returning to Ruby: Playing Nicely with Nuxt\n\nSo Ruby, or more specifically Ruby on Rails, is a web framework that I started using about a decade ago. In the past few years, I've been writing code for it in only a professional capacity as my more personal interests diverged into static site generation and Nuxt, but... I think it's the backend I do want to return to. I love Ruby. But I also love my new approach to the frontend. The question is, and it's a big unanswered one for me... can I get Nuxt and Ruby to play nicely.\n\nPreferably, I would have a single repo per project that has both frontend and backend applications which can - but don't necessarily have to - run on the same server with a single click deploy. Getting them to work on different servers is trivial; but what about the same one? At deploy time, Ruby needs to run some asset precompilation, database migrations and then it runs a full application on a server, performing computations for every visitor. Nuxt, meanwhile, needs to build at deploy time and then it can be served either rendered on server by Node.js (I think) or as static JavaScript files injected into HTML documents. So there are some choices there and questions about what's even possible... All of it is, technically, possible. But if we're strictly aiming for a single-click deploy, for ease of other users installing this themselves, then we may run into issues. Can one of the hosting platforms offering such deploys handle my demands here? Can both of the ones I'm currently using (Heroku and Railway) do so? I don't know. It remains to be seen, but I'm itching to get started on these projects so I will visit that idea again real soon.\n\n## Project \"Dashboard\"\n\nFinally, much as with my blogging, not everything I want to do or want to show off really fits in any existing project, but I also don't want to necessarily start some new project either. I have this idea to host a sort of... dashboard of widgets showing off various web development knowledge I already have or will obtain in one place. A dumping ground, essentially, for random code like... here's a clock, here's a weather forecast, here's a map and here's a 3D model of the moon, or whatever. Maybe I'll call it \"snippets\" and try to make the code snippets as easily viewed as the actual results as well. We'll see. It's on the back burner for now, but I'm interested in throwing it together quickly using Nuxt and TNT; we'll see if it too needs a Ruby API for a backend... or, in fact, several, dependent on the type of data each concept needs.\n\n## The Future: Refining My Computer Science Skills and Knowledge\n\nOkay, and finally, finally... I know a whole lot about programming. I do. I've been doing this for almost ten years professionally, for practically twenty as a hobbyist and longer still if we count the little bit of programming we learned in primary school. But despite all that I do know about programming, I have forgotten a whole lot about mathematics. I was watching a Matt Parker video recently in which he calculated the distances of words as a product of the millimetre distances between keys on a keyboard. To do this, he used Pythagoras', trigonometry and a little bit of something called _the dot product_ which... I haven't even heard of. This is stuff I should know - I learned trig and Pythagoras in secondary school, and I remember a bit, like a^2 + b^2 = c^2 - that's Pythagoras - but can I remember how to apply it or make use of it? Not really.\n\nThere are gaps in my knowledge, of mathematics, of computer science, and I should aim to plug those gaps. So I... don't know how I'll go about that yet. I am thinking of looking for a refresher mathematics course and then diving into more materials from there. But eventually... this will enable me to program a lot, lot more. Physics simulations, artificial intelligence perhaps, crypto... I've done a little crypto, I understood only half of what I did though. So a lot to cover. A lot to do.

When I do swap out for Rollup in the future, I believe it will be easier to do so if we already have the target behaviour implemented - that way we have an exact goal to aim for.\n\nUnfortunately, Vue CLI isn't installed in my main TNT project just yet, so I'll have to add the dependencies manually:\n\n```sh\nyarn add core-js vue\nyarn add --dev @vue/cli-plugin-babel @vue/cli-plugin-eslint @vue/cli-service babel-eslint eslint eslint-plugin-vue vue-template-compiler\n```\n\nI've also copied across the ESLint and Babel configs from a freshly created Vue CLI app. More important though are the changes I'm about to make to `package.json`...\n\nI change the location pointed to by the `main` option and add a new `build` command to the `scripts` object:\n\n```js\n\"main\" : \"dist/tnt.common.js\",\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\" : \"vue-cli-service build --target lib --name tnt ./src/index.js\",\n},\n```\n\nThen I can run:\n\n```sh\nyarn build\n```\n\n...and Vue CLI spits out a set of files including `tnt.umd.js` to a newly created `dist` folder.\n\nAnd that's it! ... Or should be, at least. I need to now go away and test this out, see if I can `import` everything correctly.\n\n_Ugh... Yup. Yup, I can. I just have a whole new problem now._\n\nSo, that worked but it looks like I now have some kind of conflict between Nuxt's use of Vue Meta and the version of Vue Meta that I invoke for Vue projects. Not a problem...\n\nWe'll just conditionally invoke Vue Meta based on whether or not the project is running Nuxt. I won't bother thinking about how to check for that implicitly just now; instead I'll just look for a truthy `nuxt` option in the options object:\n\n```js\nimport VueMeta from 'vue-meta'\n\n// ...\n\nexport default {\n  install (Vue, options) {\n    // ...\n    if (!options.nuxt) {\n      Vue.use(VueMeta)\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...and then when invoking TNT in a Nuxt project (in this case the Nuxt TNT package), we'll just set that option explicitly:\n\n```js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport TNT from '@thombruce/tnt'\n\nVue.use(TNT, { nuxt: true })\n```\n\nNice and simple, not something end users will need to worry about. Something I might do to make this a little more general purpose and configurable in the future is to swap this boolean `nuxt` option out for an object of some sort that can pick and choose features from the plugin. But this is quick and easy, and good enough for now.\n\nAll right then... Worked myself into a little bit of a confused state here by working on a couple of projects at once, but I think I'm ready to commit. Some cleaning up to do, but other than that...\n\n...commit and push my TNT changes, `yarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest` from my Nuxt TNT project. And then gradually upgrade the packages wherever I use them.\n\nWith that done, the next step really is publishing these and making sensible use of semantic versioning. But that for now is a task I leave unwritten.

We were trying to avoid making it specific to Webpack, to avoid also making it depend upon Vue CLI, so that it could have broader use. And yet, we learned how a Vue CLI plugin communicates its intentions to bundle a Webpack package by examining the Pug Vue CLI plugin, and we discovered that this is simple, straightforward and perhaps elegant. In other words, we have taken the long way around trying to avoid creating a Vue CLI plugin in order to ultimately that that is precisely what we actually want to do.

That is, it should be usable with different bundlers like Vite and Gulp as well. In doing so, we created a minimal Webpack installation and examined the parts that make my dependencies and the TNT package work. We were trying to avoid making it specific to Webpack, to avoid also making it depend upon Vue CLI, so that it could have broader use. And yet, we learned how a Vue CLI plugin communicates its intentions to bundle a Webpack package by examining the Pug Vue CLI plugin, and we discovered that this is simple, straightforward and perhaps elegant. In other words, we have taken the long way around trying to avoid creating a Vue CLI plugin in order to ultimately that that is precisely what we actually want to do. Still, it has been informative and the lessons learned can be used to document the installation of TNT without Vue CLI too.\n\nIn this post, I finally intend to finish this project by making a Vue CLI plugin for TNT that communicates its dependencies and the essential Webpack configuration that will make it work just a single line of code. By the end of this article, TNT should hopefully be as easy to install as...\n\n```sh\nvue add tnt\n```\n\nLet's get to it...\n\n---\n\n## Initialising the Plugin\n\nSo, we have a goal in sight - `vue add tnt` - and we have one example of how that can be achieved - https://github.com/jaeming/vue-cli-plugin-pug - now we just need to get there. We'll start by looking at the docs for creating a Vue CLI plugin like that one...\n\nVue have a plugin development guide for Vue CLI plugins here: https://cli.vuejs.org/dev-guide/plugin-dev.html I caught a glimpse of this the other day, and I'm particularly interested in something that caught my attention then: discoverability. Their section on [Naming and discoverability](https://cli.vuejs.org/dev-guide/plugin-dev.html#naming-and-discoverability) insists upon a naming strategy matching the form `vue-cli-plugin-<name>` or `@scope/vue-cli-plugin-<name>`. We know the `<name>` is going to be 'tnt', but what about the `@scope`? The typical scope I've used is my own name - e.g. `@thombruce/tnt`. I could continue to follow that pattern or make a change in this particular case... My question is: How does Vue CLI handle conflicting names? Answer... Found here: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/plugins-and-presets.html#installing-plugins-in-an-existing-project Elsewhere in the docs, the guide makes clear the difference:\n\n> You can also use 3rd party plugins under a specific scope. For example, if a plugin is named @foo/vue-cli-plugin-bar, you can add it with: `vue add @foo/bar`\n\nSo it's my choice, then. Do we want `vue add tnt` or `vue add @thombruce/tnt`? I'm gonna opt for scoped for the time being. Part of the reason that my other packages are scoped is... 'tnt' as the name of an NPM package was already taken by a package published 8 years ago and never updated. I'm happy with scoped, but I may change things up later. Let's create the package...\n\n```sh\nmkdir vue-cli-plugin-tnt\ncd vue-cli-plugin-tnt\ngit init\nyarn init\n# name: @thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt\n# version: 0.1.0\n# description: vue-cli plugin to add TNT with Pug, Tailwind and DaisyUI\n# entry point: index.js\n# repository url: https://github.com/thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt\n# author: Thom Bruce\n# license: MIT\n# private: false\ntouch index.js\ntouch README.md\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\nWe'll leave `index.js` empty for just the moment, but I'm adding a little title and description to `README.md`. I've also copied across the contents of a boilerplate `.gitignore` that's good for general purposes. And then...\n\n```sh\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n```\n\nI've also created the repository on GitHub and will push my initial commit now...\n\n```sh\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nThe project now exists at https://github.com/thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt. At present it lists none of the required dependencies, and it provides no instructions for initialising TNT. So that's our next step.\n\n## Install Dependencies\n\nLet's go over the dependencies we installed last time...\n\n- webpack\n- webpack-cli\n- webpack-dev-server\n- vue-loader\n- vue-template-compiler\n- style-loader\n- css-loader\n- postcss-loader\n- html-webpack-plugin\n- pug-plain-loader\n\nInteresting list. All of these are in fact already a given, with the exception of `pug-plain-loader`. Webpack will already be installed, as will Vue and the style and CSS loaders, even the PostCSS loader is one we can take for granted.\n\nMeanwhile, TNT itself lists the dependencies for Tailwind, DaisyUI, PostCSS, Pug, Vue Meta and Autoprefixer. We just need to include TNT as a dependency here, and provide the logic to be hooked into Webpack. So, it's just the two dependencies? Hmm... Three. We should add `raw-loader`; the Pug Vue CLI includes it, and my own experimental project made use of it without ever declaring the dependency explicitly (it might've failed if I'd had `.pug` files instead of Vue Single File Components). So...\n\n```sh\nyarn add https://github.com/thombruce/tnt pug-plain-loader raw-loader\n```\n\n_NOTE: TNT is not yet published on NPM. Shouldn't be a problem, but we'll revisit these dependencies in the future when it should be referencable by name instead of GitHub repository URL._\n\n## Integration Logic\n\nLast thing to do then (before we work out how to publish this as discoverable by Vue CLI) is to write the Webpack logic that should chain my steps and configuration into that used by default in Vue CLI projects.\n\nIn order to install Pug, we will be copying across the contents pretty much verbatim from https://github.com/jaeming/vue-cli-plugin-pug/blob/master/index.js. That's the Vue CLI Pug plugin, and what the logic in that file does is essentially just tell Webpack how to handle `.pug` files when it finds them and the contents of Vue Single File Components that have `<template lang=\"pug\">` as part of their contents. We want TNT to do the same, to do **exactly** the same, so we're copying that.\n\nIn our plugin's `index.js` file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = (api, options) => {\n  api.chainWebpack(webpackConfig => {\n    // Remove any existing rule added from a previous version of the plugin (npm uninstall/ yarn remove will remove the plugin, but leave behind the webpack rules)\n    webpackConfig.module.rules.delete('pug')\n\n    // Rules taken from: https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html#pug\n    webpackConfig.module\n      .rule('pug')\n        .test(/\\.pug$/)\n\n        // this applies to <template lang=\"pug\"> in Vue components\n        .oneOf('vue-loader')\n          .resourceQuery(/^\\?vue/)\n          .use('pug-plain')\n            .loader(require.resolve('pug-plain-loader'))\n            .end()\n        .end()\n\n        // this applies to pug imports inside JavaScript, i.e. .pug files\n        .oneOf('raw-pug-files')\n          .use('pug-raw')\n            .loader(require.resolve('raw-loader'))\n            .end()\n          .use('pug-plain')\n            .loader(require.resolve('pug-plain-loader'))\n            .end()\n        .end()\n  })\n}\n```\n\nBut we do need to add our own adaptations in order to inform the existing PostCSS installation that it should use the tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins we're including as dependencies. And as well as this, we want to provide some default configuration to the tailwindcss plugin.\n\nTo achieve this, I'm going to look at the existing Vue CLI Tailwind plugin by Jens Eggerstedt ([forsartis on GitHub](https://github.com/forsartis)), [forsartis/vue-cli-plugin-tailwind](https://github.com/forsartis/vue-cli-plugin-tailwind).\n\nEggerstedt's plugin includes some prompts which ask the installer if they want to create a full, minimal or no config at all for TailwindCSS. I'll be modifying this so that no prompts are asked, and my own specific TailwindCSS config gets created no matter what. Why? Well... it's going to be simplest, and for my own purposes I will generally be installing TNT any time I initialise a Vue project, so I want all of my default configuration when I do that - I want _conventions_.\n\nSo, now we're going to write a `generator.js` file for our plugin that installs the @thombruce/tnt dependency, injects the import and Vue.use for @thombruce/tnt into the project's `main.js`, and creates some default configuration files. The result of my efforts is this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = (api, options) => {\n  const postcss = readPostcssConfig(api);\n  const configs = {\n    dependencies: {\n      '@thombruce/tnt': 'https://github.com/thombruce/tnt'\n    },\n    postcss: {\n      plugins: {\n        tailwindcss: {},\n        autoprefixer: {},\n      },\n    },\n  };\n\n  configs.postcss.plugins = { ...configs.postcss.plugins, ...postcss.plugins };\n\n  api.extendPackage(configs);\n\n  api.onCreateComplete(() => {\n    importTNT(api);\n    generateConfig(api, options.initConfig);\n    injectPurgeConfig(api);\n    injectTailwindPlugins(api);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nNow, the file itself does have a bit more in it than that. There are several functions here, but I just want to refer to them by name for the time being. What's going on here? Well...\n\n1. The @thombruce/tnt dependency is being added.\n2. The PostCSS plugin configuration is being altered.\n3. These both happen in the `api.extendPackage(configs);` step.\n4. With that done and \"onCreateComplete\", we then...\n5. Generate the `import` and `Vue.use(TNT)` statements for the `main.js` file.\n6. Generate a fresh TailwindCSS config with `generateConfig`.\n7. Inject our own PurgeCSS configuration into that config.\n8. Inject our own plugins configuration into that config.\n\nAnd that's it. In fact, it works! I've tested the installation like so...\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev file:/Users/thombruce/Developer/thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt\nvue invoke @thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nPug is working, Tailwind is working, DaisyUI is working. Seemingly... all of it is working. And importantly, we have separated out the parts that make TNT work with Vue CLI and Webpack. The main TNT package now is... actually, it's pretty bare, but it has only the operational dependencies, rather than any platform-specific ones. So it's... stack-agnostic. Fantastic!\n\n```sh\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Install and configure dependencies\"\ngit push\n# Done!\n```\n\nIt isn't yet published properly, but can be installed straight from GitHub and invoked in-project with...\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev https://github.com/thombruce/vue-cli-plugin-tnt\nvue invoke @thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nThis installs TNT, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Pug, Lodash, Luxon and Vue Meta. My next step is to flesh this thing out with those features I wanted to bring across from Nuxt in the first place.

This was a problem, as preferably TNT would install its own dependencies without any extra configuration being required. So that's what we'll do today, and in doing so we will make TNT a sort-of \"proper\" Vue plugin. Let's look at how Vue Meta is initialised as an example:\n\n```js\nimport VueMeta from 'vue-meta'\n\nVue.use(VueMeta)\n```\n\nThis is what we placed in Dynamite UI's `main.js`. It installs Vue Meta as a Vue plugin. And this is something we want TNT to do instead. Meaning that actually that exact code should live somewhere in the TNT project, and Dynamite UI should instead feature:\n\n```js\nimport TNT from '@thombruce/tnt'\n\nVue.use(TNT)\n```\n\n...and to achieve that, TNT needs to export an `install()` function. This is all well documented in the Vue docs: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html\n\nAnyway, my install function is going to live in a new file in my TNT project at `src/index.js`:\n\n```sh\ncd tnt\ntouch src/index.js\n```\n\n```js\nimport VueMeta from 'vue-meta'\n\nexport default {\n  install (Vue, options) {\n    Vue.use(VueMeta)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen any project installing TNT includes `Vue.use(TNT)` now, it should run everything inside of the `install` funtion. In this case, just `Vue.use(VueMeta)` for now. Let's see if that's worked:\n\n```sh\ncd ../dynamite-ui\n```\n\nThen in `src/main.js`, I replace my old Vue Meta imports with TNT:\n\n```js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport TNT from '@thombruce/tnt'\n\nVue.use(TNT)\n```\n\nAnd see if it runs...\n\n```sh\nyarn serve\n```\n\nAh-ha, problem... Unusual problem. Dynamite UI has ESLint installed and is complaining that it can't find an ESLint configuration for the files `../tnt/src/index.js`:\n\n```text\nSyntax Error: Error: No ESLint configuration found in /Users/thombruce/Developer/tnt/src\n```\n\nI expect this is a problem with `yarn link` linked packages and wouldn't occur for a more typical installation (indeed it hasn't cropped up for other dependencies). Fortunately, there's an easy solution. In my Dynamite UI project, I just need to add to `vue.config.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  configureWebpack: {\n    resolve: { symlinks: false }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf I now try to `yarn serve` again...\n\nSuccess! Vue Meta is successfully being installed as a sort of sub-plugin of TNT. Perfect. But the configuration is still being handled by Dynamite UI...\n\nThat's not strictly a problem. In the absence of the `data-theme` attribute configured on my main Vue component, Daisy UI simply falls back to default theme behaviour. This is, in fact, preferable to a default configuration of my own as I believe it adjusts based on light/dark theme settings on the host machine. Let's move onto TailwindCSS config...\n\n---\n\nThere's quite a lot more going on to configure TailwindCSS in Dynamit UI. We have a `tailwind.config.js` file and we need to manually `import './index.css'` in `main.js`. But these items don't yet diverge from what I would like TNT to provide as default behaviour. Ergo, TNT should handle these configurations and imports if possible.\n\nThe second part is easy. I'm just going to recreate the CSS file in my TNT project at `src/assets/index.css`:\n\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\n...and import it from TNT's `src/index.js` file:\n\n```js\nimport VueMeta from 'vue-meta'\n\nimport './assets/index.css'\n\nexport default {\n  install (Vue, options) {\n    Vue.use(VueMeta)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEasy peasy! I can delete the references to this CSS file from the host project, Dynamite UI, and it's still working as intended. Perfect!\n\nBut the actual configuration of Tailwind is a little more difficult...\n\nThe question is: How does Tailwind know that it's installed? It's a better question than it sounds like. We've just discussed how TNT and Vue Meta are each acknowledged by the Vue app, but how does Vue know about Tailwind? Well...\n\nAs well as a `tailwind.config.js` file, my project also features a `postcss.config.js` file with the contents:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\nI believe we've discussed PostCSS previously - we had some version trouble. PostCSS is apparently part of the default Vue configuration, so Vue behind the scenes knows to look for this configuration file, and PostCSS in turn knows to look for these listed plugins. This, I believe, is all down to a hidden Webpack configuration. Webpack is a great tool, handles the packaging of... web things.

We in fact already have a separate repo for Nuxt installations - might we also consider one for Vue CLI? They will, _I think_ be incompatible with one another, but that's all the more reason to have a base project that works a certain way with just plain old Vue.\n\n...\n\nAll of that is to say, I have made a mistake. Dynamite UI was generated with Vue CLI, but I need to take a step backwards, go another layer up the abstraction ladder and consider how a very simple Vue project would install this package...\n\nIn other words...

For right now though, I think probably Webpack is going to give us the easiest solution thanks to its having some preconceptions, in a manner of speaking.

The issue: Vue CLI, which we used to generate the Dynamite UI project I'm working on, obfuscates a lot of the configurability of Vue and Webpack. Under the hood, Vue CLI is using Webpack... _I think_. And this can be configured from the project with our own Webpack config files, I presume, but the obscurity is making it difficult to assess the relationship between the UI project and my plugin.\n\nToday then, we're going to start from scratch and create a more barebones Vue project. This should be a minimum viable reproduction of what we ultimately want to achieve... meaning essentially we just really want two dependencies: Vue and TNT. We might find we need more, which may either need to be added to the Vue project directly or, preferably, to TNT, but the result should be a plugin that works with plain Vue projects, with Vue CLI ones and with Nuxt, because those latter two approaches build upon the first. In fact, this is what this whole \"Reworking TNT\" exercise has been about: prying TNT apart from the Nuxt logic that it previously depended on. Let's get rolling... First, we need a new project:\n\nStep one: Create an empty project folder and initialise Git.\n\n```sh\nmkdir my-vue-project\ncd my-vue-project\ngit init\n```\n\nThere's nothing to commit. The project is still empty.\n\nStep two: Initialise Yarn.\n\n```sh\nyarn init\n```\n\nThis runs an interactive session. I'm not going to change any of the default values, though; this is just a throwaway project.\n\nStep three: Install the two main dependencies - Vue and TNT - and link to our local version of TNT for development.\n\n```sh\nyarn add vue https://github.com/thombruce/tnt\nyarn link @thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nOne thing worth noticing is that at this point, a `node_modules` directory will have been generated. We don't want that to be committed, so we'll add a `.gitignore` file to the root of our project with `node_modules/` in there to be ignored by Git:\n\n```sh\necho \"node_modules/\" > .gitignore\n```\n\nAnd let's `git commit`...\n\n```sh\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Initialize project\"\n```\n\nSo, Vue and TNT along with all of their child dependencies are now installed...\n\nNext, I'm just going to copy over some files from my Dynamite UI project; specifically, `src/App.vue` and `src/main.js`. These are the main components that tell Vue what my app looks like and how to render it; they just need some minor alterations for this more basic setup. Removal of any references to VueRouter and the Vuex Store, neither of which is installed. After that, my `src/main.js` looks like this:\n\n```js\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\n\nimport TNT from '@thombruce/tnt'\n\nVue.config.productionTip = false\n\nVue.use(TNT)\n\nnew Vue({\n  render: h => h(App)\n}).$mount('#app')\n```\n\nI've also created a minimal `index.html` file in a new `public` folder, the main part of which is that it includes this:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"app\"></div>\n```\n\nThis is where the Vue project will ultimately be injected...\n\nSo I've got an `App.vue` which handles how the app will be rendered, I have a `main.js` which tells Vue how to render and it how to behave... and I have an `index.html` where it should be injected but... isn't, because I still do have to do _the next thing_.\n\nVue's own documentation is pretty shy on how to handle this part; the part where Vue is packaged into the HTML template. The docs really seem to favour Vue CLI, which handles all of this automatically. For manual configuration, they link us to Webpack's documentation. Webpack isn't our only option - one can argue that a package like Gulp is simpler and more elegant, particularly for simple cases, and there's Vite too which is a new kid on the package bundling scene from the creators of Vue. For right now though, I think probably Webpack is going to give us the easiest solution thanks to its having some preconceptions, in a manner of speaking. For instance, whereas Gulp would require us to write our own bundling script, Webpack abstracts that part and has some base assumptions about web projects. Like by default, Webpack will look for a `src/index.js` and will output the result of bundling that file to `dist/main.js`. We may need to install some custom loaders, like Vue Loader... maybe. But err... well, we'll get to that. So...\n\nStep four: Install Webpack and other bundling necessities.\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server vue-loader vue-template-compiler style-loader css-loader postcss-loader html-webpack-plugin\n```\n\nThat's err... a lot of dependencies. And there's at least one missing that we might have mentioned - pug-plain-loader - but this is already being installed by TNT, so there's no need to respecify it. All of these are loaders, bundlers and plugins for Webpack's packaging of the app as a webpage. Also notable: webpack-dev-server is a package that will let us run the bundled application in development mode, just makes it a little easier to check things are working.\n\nRight, but this needs configuring... First, let's add the build and development build scripts to `package.json` for convenience:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\",\n  \"start\": \"webpack-dev-server --mode development\"\n},\n```\n\nThat way I can just run `yarn start` to run the dev server. But it still needs a Webpack configuration to reference... That's a bit more verbose.\n\nIn a new file, `webpack.config.js`, I have got:\n\n```js\nconst { VueLoaderPlugin } = require(\"vue-loader\")\nconst htmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\")\nconst path = require(\"path\")\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: {\n    main: \"./src/main.js\"\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: \"vue-loader\"\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.pug$/,\n        oneOf: [\n          {\n            resourceQuery: /^\\?vue/,\n            use: ['pug-plain-loader']\n          },\n          {\n            use: ['raw-loader', 'pug-plain-loader']\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: [\n          \"style-loader\",\n          \"css-loader\",\n          {\n            loader: \"postcss-loader\",\n            options: {\n              postcssOptions: {\n                plugins: [\n                  [\"tailwindcss\", {}],\n                  [\"autoprefixer\", {}]\n                ]\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new VueLoaderPlugin(),\n    new htmlWebpackPlugin({\n      template: path.resolve(__dirname, \"public\", \"index.html\")\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nA pretty minimal Webpack configuration, all things considered. I don't know if it's the **absolute** minimum for my needs, but it's minimal enough.\n\nApart from this, I also have a `tailwind.config.js` file with contents:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: {\n    options: {\n      safelist: [\n        /data-theme$/,\n      ]\n    },\n    content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],\n  },\n  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),\n    require('daisyui'),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nThese contents could in fact be inserted into the Webpack config file instead, in the empty object at `[\"tailwindcss\", {}],`... I could in fact also separate out the PostCSS config from Webpack into a `postcss.config.js` file, which includes that declaration. In fact...\n\nThat could be the answer to my problem.\n\nSee, I already know that Tailwind's config file location can be customised by setting its path explicitly in the PostCSS config: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#using-a-different-file-name\n\nI can also change the path to the default PostCSS config file by passing the option to the PostCSS loader: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-load-config/issues/55#issuecomment-266375307\n\nThe combination of these two options should enable me to specify that my PostCSS config and my Tailwind config live in my TNT plugin's folder... right? Obviously.\n\nAnd because the config files are JavaScript, I should be able to have them (or some other part of the stack) communicate that **if** a config file does exist in the root project directory, **then** do use that instead. That way, an end user would only have to install the essential dependencies, then reference our PostCSS config file, and things would... work seamlessly.\n\nIs that the best approach? Probably not...\n\n---\n\n### Quick Aside\n\nI mentioned pug-plain-loader specifically up above. Is this strictly a dependency of TNT or is it one that should be moved into the inheriting projects? I sort of just install it out of habit every time I install Pug. Strictly though, it is a Webpack dependency... meaning that if an inheriting project used Vite or Gulp or some other process to package things, it wouldn't be essential. So then...\n\n```sh\ncd ../tnt\nyarn remove pug-plain-loader\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Remove pug-plain-loader\"\ngit push\ncd ../my-vue-project\nyarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest\nyarn add --dev pug-plain-loader\n```\n\nI also need to `yarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest` over on Dynamite UI and `yarn add --dev pug-plain-loader` so that that continues to work as well. I don't need to modify any Webpack business there, because it seems Vue CLI still picks up on the use of Pug automatically... however I could instead use the `vue add pug` option to install Pug via Vue CLI template.\n\nIn fact looking at the package for vue-cli-plugin-pug at https://github.com/jaeming/vue-cli-plugin-pug... There isn't a great deal going on there. Just a `package.json` file with pug, pug-plain-loader and raw-loader dependencies and an `index.js` which chains into the Webpack setup. So hold up just a second! Could I create a \"vue-cli-plugin-tnt\" that does the same? That, for example, includes all of the Webpack and loader dependencies I would want and chains into the Webpack process to configure those? Answer...\n\nYes, I absolutely could do that for Vue CLI projects. It would list TNT as a dependency, configure it automatically, and we'd be rolling...\n\nSo then... we should absolutely keep TNT Core, let's call it, as barebones as possible. Make no assumptions that the end user will be using Webpack or some other bundler, or Vue CLI or Nuxt, and instead maintain separate dependencies which specifically install it for Vue CLI and Nuxt, and... for plain Vue?

I've since decided to broaden the subject material of this website to include all of my programming work, a lot of it but not all being Jamstack related._\n\nGreetings curious parties and welcome to Jameater. I'm Thom Bruce, the author of this here blog and an ever-greater-and-greater advocate of the Jamstack. But what is the Jamstack, what's a Jameater and why am I writing about this? Well...\n\n## What is the Jamstack?\n\nThe Jamstack (also stylised as JAMStack) is an approach to website architecture that emphasises the use of JavaScript, server-based APIs and markup, hence the name: **J**avaScript + **A**PI + **M**arkup = **JAM**Stack. Not every Jamstack website uses all three, but in principle all three are all a Jamstack website would ever use. To illustrate, let's consider _\"baby's first website\"_.\n\n_\"Baby's first website\"_ is that first website that every web designer and developer ever produces. I threw my first website together when I was 11 with a _teach yourself HTML_ book I'd picked up at a Scholastic Book Fair. It didn't actually use any JavaScript, and it certainly didn't use any APIs, but I would make the case that this - a site comprised of purely HTML markup and a bit of CSS - was a Jamstack website. Which kinda means... the 'M' in 'JAMStack' is sort of... _the old way_ of doing websites. Most modern websites generate their HTML on a server using back-end code; this is how WordPress works, how Drupal and Joomla work, it's how Ruby on Rails works. It's... _the modern approach_. But a lot of the time, this _modern approach_ is unnecessary. A lot of sites that are running from servers, don't actually need those servers; they could be built on the Jamstack.\n\nSo, how does this work? Well you take _\"baby's first website\"_, for example, and you decide you want to add a little user interactivity - let them change the colours, say, or add a comment or a like. The way to do that without having a server to compute the change is to do it right in the user's browser; for that, we use JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language understood by browsers, making it actually the most commonly used programming language in the world. It doesn't matter if your website is written on the backend in Ruby or PHP, or put together in WordPress, or it's just _\"baby's first website\"_ made of pure markup, JavaScript adds that frontend interaction that we've all grown accustomed to. _I should caveat this: A lot of interactivity can also be achieved with CSS alone, and where that's the case it usually should be, but JavaScript allows for plenty more advanced use cases._\n\nAnd finally, there's the A in JAM - APIs. Because you don't need to run _\"baby's first website\"_ on a server just to be able to add comments or likes to _baby's_ posts. You just need access to a smaller, more dedicated server that handles user interactions. So you take the markup you've already got (which you can serve online without a server), you add a little JavaScript that says \"when the user hits this button, send this information\", and you send that information to an API that is dedicated to handling that sort of information. Et voila, _baby_ just deployed to the full Jamstack!\n\nI'll discuss further concepts in later posts, like Static Site Generators are a pretty important concept; instead of writing page after page of HTML markup, an SSG will build the markup for your pages for you from templates and components that you customise. An SSG does a lot of the stuff that a WordPress server would to render a page, but whereas WordPress would go through this process on every single user request, an SSG only does this once. You build once and deploy to a serverless architecture, serving up what's known as a _\"static site\"_. These static sites become dynamic by use of JavaScript and APIs, but that's... precisely the same way that all websites feel modern and dynamic. Can you imagine if Facebook loaded a new page every time you wanted to leave a \"like\" on something? That's interactivity without JavaScript and APIs; it's page-loads, yeuch!\n\nA quick and easy way to get started with Static Site Generators, if you're interested, is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I no longer use this myself (this blog uses [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)), but I do think Jekyll wins out for ease-of-use.\n\n## What is a Jameater?\n\nA derogatory term for someone from either one of two local towns, Whitehaven or Workington, who eats jam sandwiches (jelly sandwiches, if you're American).

It comes with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, each with some pre-configurations so that things like theme-switching and CSS purging work. It also comes with the Nuxt Font Awesome module, my own Nuxt Taxonomies project, Lodash, Luxon and Pug... and it insists that Nuxt Content should be a peer dependency (meaning it doesn't install it itself, but your project would be expected to have it installed separately). So a lot of that is Nuxt-specific, but I would like to use Pug, Luxon, Lodash and Tailwind as common dependencies of my Vue projects too. And I would like many of the components I've written or will write for TNT to be available to Vue.js projects as well. What does this mean? Well... I'm going to have to do some rewriting. Ideally, I don't want to be maintaining two wholly distinct libraries to roughly do the same thing for two frameworks, particularly while the frameworks are very closely related. Instead... I either want one library that can be installed in projects of either framework, or I want my Nuxt-specific library to inherit from the Vue one, given that Nuxt is really just an extension of Vue. That's easier said than done. Like I said, this little library is heavily dependent on Nuxt at the moment. And it's possible we'll lose some of the desirable features of those Nuxt versions of libraries by replacing them with either packages made for just Vue instead, or general-purpose ones intended for any NPM-managed project. We'll have to ask the questions: What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Tailwind with just TailwindCSS? What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Font Awesome with Vue Font Awesome or with just Font Awesome? How do we reconcile the inclusion of Nuxt Taxonomies in Vue projects it's completely irrelevant to? If those losses are undesirable or even impermissible, what is the best approach to separate out Nuxt dependencies whilst keeping the core part of TNT's development in one place?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"creating-dynamite"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#creating-dynamite","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Creating Dynamite"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So, one small part of the reason I started TNT is that I thought such a template could ultimately be useful for creating websites for clients.

It's also intended to permit me to stop overthinking decisions about UI frameworks and CSS libraries. TailwindCSS makes every component very customisable, while DaisyUI provides a solid foundation for making those customisations. TNT, I thought, would be a strong starting point for any of my projects, whether it be a simple blogging website or a rich application dashboard. And honestly it's well on its way. But it's Nuxt dependent, and not all of my Vue projects will be Nuxt ones. At least I never intended for that to be the case, and now that I've reviewed how I might integrate a Vue or Nuxt frontend with a Rails backend... I don't think it can be. So, I need a new Vue project to play around with. For that, I'm going to make a start on Dynamite CMS, a sort of cousing to my TNT project - it's a content management system intended to work in particular with content websites created using TNT.

It comes with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, each with some pre-configurations so that things like theme-switching and CSS purging work. It also comes with the Nuxt Font Awesome module, my own Nuxt Taxonomies project, Lodash, Luxon and Pug... and it insists that Nuxt Content should be a peer dependency (meaning it doesn't install it itself, but your project would be expected to have it installed separately). So a lot of that is Nuxt-specific, but I would like to use Pug, Luxon, Lodash and Tailwind as common dependencies of my Vue projects too. And I would like many of the components I've written or will write for TNT to be available to Vue.js projects as well. What does this mean? Well... I'm going to have to do some rewriting. Ideally, I don't want to be maintaining two wholly distinct libraries to roughly do the same thing for two frameworks, particularly while the frameworks are very closely related. Instead... I either want one library that can be installed in projects of either framework, or I want my Nuxt-specific library to inherit from the Vue one, given that Nuxt is really just an extension of Vue. That's easier said than done. Like I said, this little library is heavily dependent on Nuxt at the moment. And it's possible we'll lose some of the desirable features of those Nuxt versions of libraries by replacing them with either packages made for just Vue instead, or general-purpose ones intended for any NPM-managed project. We'll have to ask the questions: What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Tailwind with just TailwindCSS? What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Font Awesome with Vue Font Awesome or with just Font Awesome? How do we reconcile the inclusion of Nuxt Taxonomies in Vue projects it's completely irrelevant to? If those losses are undesirable or even impermissible, what is the best approach to separate out Nuxt dependencies whilst keeping the core part of TNT's development in one place?\n\n## Creating Dynamite\n\nSo, one small part of the reason I started TNT is that I thought such a template could ultimately be useful for creating websites for clients. It currently features two distinct styles of layout and, thanks to DaisyUI, more than a dozen themes. It's intended to be versatile, then. It's also intended to permit me to stop overthinking decisions about UI frameworks and CSS libraries. TailwindCSS makes every component very customisable, while DaisyUI provides a solid foundation for making those customisations. TNT, I thought, would be a strong starting point for any of my projects, whether it be a simple blogging website or a rich application dashboard. And honestly it's well on its way. But it's Nuxt dependent, and not all of my Vue projects will be Nuxt ones. At least I never intended for that to be the case, and now that I've reviewed how I might integrate a Vue or Nuxt frontend with a Rails backend... I don't think it can be. So, I need a new Vue project to play around with. For that, I'm going to make a start on Dynamite CMS, a sort of cousing to my TNT project - it's a content management system intended to work in particular with content websites created using TNT. We'll see if that intention remains the same as the project progresses, for now I just need a simple Vue application where I can play with my TNT template library. Let's create that...\n\n```sh\nvue create dynamite-ui\ncd dynamite-ui\n```\n\nThe `vue` command depends on Vue CLI being installed and runs an interactive menu allowing me to choose various options. Most of these aren't relevant to the discussion, except that I am specifically _not_ initialising the project with a CSS pre-processor. The project will be using TailwindCSS, PostCSS and - I think - PurgeCSS, which can't be installed that way. Plus, they will be part of TNT, not the parent project.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking comes next...\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev https://github.com/thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nThis will install TNT, which I know I've said will be incompatible with Vue... but I don't really know just _how incompatible_ it will be. Maybe this way I can get a sense of what works, what doesn't, and what I need to change.\n\nPredictably after running that command, there are a lot of things installed that I do not want. So I'm gonna jump on over to TNT...\n\n```sh\ncd ../tnt\ngit co -b vue\ngit push --set-upstream origin vue\n```\n\nI've also checked out a brand new branch called 'vue' and set the upstream branch on GitHub to this new branch. Not exactly what that means, but if you're unfamiliar with Git or version control at all... essentially now I can make as many modifications as I want without losing the previous state, which is saved as a separate branch on GitHub. Used properly, you always maintain a detailed history with version control meaning you can reset the project at any time to any previous point in time. It also facilitates collaboration, testing, etc. If you're a developer not using version control, start.\n\nWhat next? Now I need to do what I just said and butcher TNT a little. Remove all the Nuxt dependencies and replace them with Vue or non-framework-specific ones.\n\nThe main script aside, the TNT project essentially consists of four folders: assets, components, layouts and plugins. Of these, assets and plugins should have no problems. We can incorporate their contents into a Vue project with relative ease. In my components and layouts folders, however... well, let's ignore layouts for now - it actually is Nuxt specific. The components folder, however, has several instances of `NuxtLink` and the `<Nuxt />` component being used. We can ignore the instances of the `<Nuxt />` component, as these are layout-specific, but those NuxtLinks do need to be addressed before the same components will work in Vue. That part's easy; for the most part, `NuxtLink` just becomes `RouterLink`... _I think that still works in Nuxt..._ But actually there are a lot of other problems with these components: uses of the `fetch()` hook, uses of Nuxt Content, Nuxt Taxonomies and some Nuxt variables. I don't want to sacrifice some of that, so I've made a decision...\n\nThere will at least be two directories (probably two separate libraries). One for Vue components, and one for Nuxt components. The Nuxt components will use, inherit from and extend the Vue ones with Nuxt functionality. The Vue ones will be more general purpose, unable to utilise some of Nuxt's features.\n\nSo we probably want to start a new project entirely. TNT should be general purpose, working for both Vue and Nuxt; a separate project, _Nuxt TNT_, should expand upon it. _Decision made!_\n\nI've moved `@thombruce/tnt` to `@thombruce/nuxt-tnt` and have started a brand new project in the old namespace. The docs remain in the `@thombruce/tnt` repo, but other than that it is barebones at the moment. Time to start migrating some components and picking out our dependencies. I won't worry for now about having Nuxt TNT inherit from the new project - that can be left as an exercise for later. For now, I'm simply aiming to get some of that TNT goodness to work for Vue projects not using Nuxt.\n\nAfter some messing around, I have a clean TNT repository with no code. But it's pushed to GitHub, so jumping back across to my new Dynamite UI project, I can install this empty package...\n\n```sh\ncd ../dynamite-ui\nyarn remove @thombruce/tnt\nyarn cache clean # To clean up any references to the old version and its Git history\nyarn add https://github.com/thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nI've removed the old and installed the new. Now I want to be able to actively develop this and see the results on my own machine without having to push the dependency. Fortunately, there's `yarn link`.\n\n```sh\ncd ../tnt\nyarn link\ncd ../dynamite-ui\nyarn link @thombruce/tnt\n```\n\nNow, Dynamite UI will use the local, linked version of TNT in development on my machine, so any changes I make will be applied almost immediately (definitely immediately if I have Hot Module Replacement up and running). Time to start actually adding dependencies and components to this thing!\n\n---\n\nThe first dependency I want to install is Pug. I don't know how easy this is going to be though. Usually I can just `vue add pug` and depend on Vue CLI's implementation, but as I'm working on a plugin I think I'll take my old approach...\n\n```sh\ncd ../tnt\nyarn add pug pug-plain-loader\n```\n\nNow, that's - I think - all that's required to get Pug working in the TNT plugin. Unfortunately I don't know if the new dependency will be installed over on Dynamite UI as a linked module... I may need to push TNT and `yarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest`. `yarn link` was maybe not made for managing nested dependencies - it wasn't. But if I do remember rightly, Vue should have no problem with just the addition of pug and pug-plain-loader to dependencies. I think Webpack detects their presence, and so no additional config will be needed... at least once I do get this properly installed over on Dynamite UI. But since I need to push and then upgrade, I may as well get a few other dependencies installed too. I certainly want...\n\n- Pug\n- TailwindCSS\n- TailwindCSS Forms\n- DaisyUI\n- Theme Change\n- PostCSS (though I think this is already installed)\n- Lodash\n- Luxon\n\nThat's all of the dependencies from Nuxt TNT except the icon libraries and those that are Nuxt-specific. _We'll revisit icon libraries later._ Fortunately the only dependency listed above that I was using a Nuxt-specific version of is TailwindCSS; all others are general purpose. So picking the packages to install is pretty easy...\n\nThe TailwindCSS docs suggest an install command of `npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest`, which includes PostCSS (we believe already installed) and Autoprefixer, which we definitely want too, so... they join the installation:\n\n```sh\nyarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest @tailwindcss/forms daisyui lodash luxon theme-change\n```\n\nAnd since we need to push the project to upgrade it over on Dynamite UI...\n\n```sh\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Install dependencies\"\ngit push\ncd ../dynamite-ui\nyarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest\n```\n\nChecking the Yarn lockfile over on Dynamite UI, I can confirm that my dependencies are properly installed. To be doubly sure that at least Pug is working, I've modified the default app template of Dynamite UI to express itself in Pug format and I'm running `yarn serve`... Navigating to localhost:8080 in my browser... Yup, that appears to be working!\n\nI'm also confident that Lodash, Luxon and Theme Change are all installed fine, as I will be importing these directly for the most part and don't need global access to them. They're installed, so they're installed successfully.\n\nTailwindCSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, TailwindCSS Forms and DaisyUI... Those need more configuration, and that's not easy or immediately apparent how to achieve. With Nuxt, I benefited from a bunch of build hooks that I could tap into to: 1. Configure the installation in the TNT package itself, and 2. Allow for this configuration to be overwritten per project.\n\nIt's been a little while since I made a proper Vue plugin, so I don't know what options are available to me. For the time being, I think I'm going to configure TailwindCSS directly in the Dynamite UI project... That way I can get a feel for what sort of configuration needs to made and what I need to be able to overwrite.\n\n```sh\n# Still in dynamite-ui\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Tailwind: npx tailwindcss init -p\"\n# Modify Tailwind config to enable PurgeCSS\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Tailwind: Configure PurgeCSS\"\n# Configure Tailwind CSS\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Tailwind: Configure default CSS\"\n```\n\nThese are the steps detailed at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite. I've also committed each step so that I will be able to review my git history and see these changes specifically, and in order.\n\nTailwindCSS Forms is also very easy to add. Just require it from the plugins section in `tailwind.config.js` and...\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),\n  ],\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nDone. Don't forget to commit the change:\n\n```sh\n# Add TailwindCSS forms as a Tailwind plugin\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Tailwind: Add Tailwind Forms plugin\"\n```\n\nDaisyUI and and Theme Change are a little more involved. In fact... I never fully got Theme Change working properly with the Nuxt package, though it was close enough - it changed themes, but it didn't successfully load the correct theme on subsequent visits. That's an issue I'll address in the future.\n\nDaisyUI itself is easy enough to add. Like TailwindCSS Forms, all we need to do is require it as a plugin in our Tailwind config. We'll also safelist the data-theme attribute here so that DaisyUI's themes aren't purged by PurgeCSS:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: {\n    options: {\n      safelist: [\n        /data-theme$/,\n      ]\n    },\n    // ...\n  },\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),\n    require('daisyui'),\n  ],\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nGenerally, I think it's supposed to be a good idea to require DaisyUI last... The DaisyUI docs say nothing about TailwindCSS Forms, but they do suggest that if we were using TailwindCSS Typography (a plugin for applying typographic styles to content over which we have little markup control) then it should be required after that because it extends some of its styles. We'll just roll with the assumption that DaisyUI should come last unless otherwise specified.\n\nWe also need to add that `data-theme` attribute to our HTML tag in `public/index.html`. There has to be a better way to do this, but for now we'll do this the easy way:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"\" data-theme=\"cupcake\">\n```\n\nLet's commit all of that...\n\n```sh\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Tailwind: Add DaisyUI plugin\"\n```\n\nNow, the issue is Theme Change... I'm actually going to double-back and remove Theme Change for now:\n\n```sh\ncd ../tnt\nyarn remove theme-change\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Uninstall theme-change\"\n```\n\nWhy do that? Because actually adding `data-theme` directly to the `<html>` tag above is a mess-enough for the time being, and because being able to change the theme on the fly isn't critical to my development. There are things I want to manage before we reach that point.\n\nBut where are we at now?\n\n- TailwindCSS and DaisyUI should each be properly installed\n- Pug we already know is working\n- Lodash and Luxon are safely assumed to be ready to use\n\nThis puts me in position to start adding my own templates and components! For the time being, we'll grant that many of the steps above are required to get the TNT plugin working - we'll refine that in the future. The last thing to do at this stage is to create a layout and a component using Tailwind and DaisyUI; and if that works, we've completed this setup.\n\nOne quick copying over of one of my TNT layouts and... Error!\n\n```text\nError: PostCSS plugin tailwindcss requires PostCSS 8.\n```\n\nNot to worry, I've seen this before. In fact, it's an issue that the Tailwind team are aware of an provide a solution to: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build So then...\n\n```sh\nyarn remove tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nyarn add tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Use TailwindCSS Compatibility version\"\ngit push\n```\n\nThis swaps out the latest version of Tailwind for a compatibility version, the same in every way apparently apart from that it maintains compatibility with older versions of PostCSS.\n\nLet's jump back across to DynamiteUI...\n\n```sh\ncd ../dynamite-ui\nyarn upgrade @thombruce/tnt --latest\nyarn serve\n```\n\nSuccess! TailwindCSS is now working, DaisyUI and the chosen theme as well, my custom layout...\n\nNow, it isn't ideal. A lot has been done on DynamiteUI that I'd rather be done in the TNT plugin, but this is a start. It's a lot easier to migrate that functionality up the stream so to speak into TNT than it is to fiddle endlessly with plugin functionality.\n\nThis is the first step. I'm in a position to start developing, because the dependencies I need are all now installed by the one package... they just aren't yet configured by it. We might cover configuring Vue plugins in another post soon, but I'm calling this one here.
