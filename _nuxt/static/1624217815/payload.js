It didn't actually use any JavaScript, and it certainly didn't use any APIs, but I would make the case that this - a site comprised of purely HTML markup and a bit of CSS - was a Jamstack website. Which kinda means... the 'M' in 'JAMStack' is sort of... "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"the old way"}]},{type:a,value:" of doing websites. Most modern websites generate their HTML on a server using back-end code; this is how WordPress works, how Drupal and Joomla work, it's how Ruby on Rails works. It's... "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"the modern approach"}]},{type:a,value:". But a lot of the time, this "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"modern approach"}]},{type:a,value:" is unnecessary.

Well you take "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:u}]},{type:a,value:", for example, and you decide you want to add a little user interactivity - let them change the colours, say, or add a comment or a like. The way to do that without having a server to compute the change is to do it right in the user's browser; for that, we use JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language understood by browsers, making it actually the most commonly used programming language in the world. It doesn't matter if your website is written on the backend in Ruby or PHP, or put together in WordPress, or it's just "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:u}]},{type:a,value:" made of pure markup, JavaScript adds that frontend interaction that we've all grown accustomed to. "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I should caveat this: A lot of interactivity can also be achieved with CSS alone, and where that's the case it usually should be, but JavaScript allows for plenty more advanced use cases."}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"And finally, there's the A in JAM - APIs.

You just need access to a smaller, more dedicated server that handles user interactions. So you take the markup you've already got (which you can serve online without a server), you add a little JavaScript that says \"when the user hits this button, send this information\", and you send that information to an API that is dedicated to handling that sort of information. Et voila, "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"baby"}]},{type:a,value:" just deployed to the full Jamstack!"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I'll discuss further concepts in later posts, like Static Site Generators are a pretty important concept; instead of writing page after page of HTML markup, an SSG will build the markup for your pages for you from templates and components that you customise.

You build once and deploy to a serverless architecture, serving up what's known as a "},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"\"static site\""}]},{type:a,value:". These static sites become dynamic by use of JavaScript and APIs, but that's... precisely the same way that all websites feel modern and dynamic.
