This, I said, would make development a lot easier. It does. A caveat I didn't mention is that it could make dependency relationships harder to manage... which it, err... does, sort of. In some respects, dependencies are easy to manage between the three projects, and in other respects it is a little more difficult to have the three communicate with one another. But not to worry; that's where tools like "},{type:b,tag:u,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fclassic.yarnpkg.com\u002Fen\u002Fdocs\u002Fworkspaces\u002F",rel:[B,C,D],target:E},children:[{type:a,value:"Yarn Workspaces"}]},{type:a,value:" and "},{type:b,tag:u,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Flerna\u002Flerna",rel:[B,C,D],target:E},children:[{type:a,value:y}]},{type:a,value:" come in. The first of these, Yarn Workspaces, is a way to share dependencies between the three projects as well as having each one depend on the others during development. The second, Lerna, does that same thing as well in a different way, but on top of that it also offers some version management and publishing tools."}]},{type:a,value:f},{type:b,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"So, what's the benefit and what's the difference? Well, the main feature of both Yarn Workspaces and Lerna is multi-package dependency management. With Yarn Workspaces active, for instance, one only has to run "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:F}]},{type:a,value:" from the base directory and Yarn will iterate through all of the packages and install all of their dependencies. It installs all dependencies in the project root as well, so that the packages all share their common dependencies, significantly lowering the install time and size. And it symlinks the other packages in the workspace, so that the local, development version of each package is used in development. All of this, Lerna does as well but slightly differently. And Lerna adds the capability to run scripts across all packages, manage semantic versioning across them all, and publish all of them to the NPM registry with a single command. So then... if Lerna does the same and more, why have I chosen to use both?"}]},{type:a,value:f},{type:b,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Good question. I actually did experiment with using Lerna alone, but it doesn't play nicely with Yarn's package management which I was already using. It's also had a series of developments that seem to have outpaced documentation - that is to say, it isn't poorly documented, but the documentation is somewhat incomplete and in need of some clarification. Aside from this, Yarn Workspaces is a native solution which is typically something you can depend on. It just isn't as feature rich as Lerna, so... we're lucky that Lerna has this under consideration and can be configured to work with Yarn Workspaces instead of its own dependency management solution. The resultant setup is something I absolutely adore, and am sure to use again in the future.
