That part is... a little selfish. I mean it makes sense; Ruby is a beloved language with a lot of support and development in the open source community. But also... it's the language that my career is based on, and that's the main reason I'm pushing for it. Which again... makes sense. I've worked with Ruby for about ten years, so I of course should run with it as my experience will be of great benefit while managing such a project. That said, it doesn't couple with Nuxt as I'd hoped it might... and other backends like Node.js' Express do. I know for a fact I want what at least functions like a single-repository installation - one click deploys and all that good stuff; essentially something that behaves like a monorepo. If I really want to use Nuxt then... well, the choice should probably be Express. I can couple Vue, the framework Nuxt is based on, with Rails just fine but... do I lose the capability to offer a frontend only install? Say for anyone wanting to deploy their own frontend but using a hosted API? Or for packaging the project as a desktop or mobile app. That is possible with Rails, but a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) is probably preferred, right?"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Mainly I'm muddling through all of these questions because I have a contradiction of wants: I want to use Rails, I want to use Nuxt.

As a compromise, I can use Vue in place of Nuxt but I wouldn't have access to my own TNT project unless I modified it extensively... which I'm not ruling out, but that will be a later consideration.

I don't want any developer or other user to have to install several different parts just to get the application running. If they want to host and run the software, this should ideally be a one-click process. Similarly, if they want to run the frontend elsewhere and benefit from someone else's hosting (either paid or provided freely), this too should ideally be a one-click process with ideally only one or two details to configure (the host domain for the backend). Maybe it should have a default host, meaning a true one-click deploy but potentially giving favourable weight to my own hosted solution... or maybe it should ideally also run without requiring a backend.

Broadly... there should be options. Like, I can't right now justify hosting an online application for any number of users at no cost to them; but I will always be able to justify making that software free for them to install and host themselves. Perhaps a ways down the line, we can have a paid service model that offers managed hosting, but I'll always keep the core, open source project free in the sense of both liberty and beer."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Ease of development is very much a case of keeping code well-written, well-documented and well-tested. In these efforts, we will benefit from the underlying tech stack being well-supported and loved by the community. I've pretty much settled on Ruby and Vue for the back and front end respectively - these both have large, supportive communities. Ease of development then is just a matter of ensuring that the code always remains clear, documented and tested. It also ties into whether or not the software is easy to install; ideally, a developer should be able to pull the project once and get it running without any unconventional changes in their setup. That is to say, if they have Ruby and they have Node installed, this should run on their system no problem. The rest of the stack, then, should be environment agnostic.
