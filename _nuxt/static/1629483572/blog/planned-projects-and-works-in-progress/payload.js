I'm writing these blog posts in a code editor right now; the formatting is readable but it isn't pretty, and it doesn't even try to approximate what it will look like to a website visitor - it's plain text.

At deploy time, Ruby needs to run some asset precompilation, database migrations and then it runs a full application on a server, performing computations for every visitor. Nuxt, meanwhile, needs to build at deploy time and then it can be served either rendered on server by Node.js (I think) or as static JavaScript files injected into HTML documents. So there are some choices there and questions about what's even possible... All of it is, technically, possible. But if we're strictly aiming for a single-click deploy, for ease of other users installing this themselves, then we may run into issues. Can one of the hosting platforms offering such deploys handle my demands here? Can both of the ones I'm currently using (Heroku and Railway) do so? I don't know.
