It comes with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, each with some pre-configurations so that things like theme-switching and CSS purging work. It also comes with the Nuxt Font Awesome module, my own Nuxt Taxonomies project, Lodash, Luxon and Pug... and it insists that Nuxt Content should be a peer dependency (meaning it doesn't install it itself, but your project would be expected to have it installed separately). So a lot of that is Nuxt-specific, but I would like to use Pug, Luxon, Lodash and Tailwind as common dependencies of my Vue projects too. And I would like many of the components I've written or will write for TNT to be available to Vue.js projects as well. What does this mean? Well... I'm going to have to do some rewriting. Ideally, I don't want to be maintaining two wholly distinct libraries to roughly do the same thing for two frameworks, particularly while the frameworks are very closely related. Instead... I either want one library that can be installed in projects of either framework, or I want my Nuxt-specific library to inherit from the Vue one, given that Nuxt is really just an extension of Vue. That's easier said than done. Like I said, this little library is heavily dependent on Nuxt at the moment. And it's possible we'll lose some of the desirable features of those Nuxt versions of libraries by replacing them with either packages made for just Vue instead, or general-purpose ones intended for any NPM-managed project. We'll have to ask the questions: What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Tailwind with just TailwindCSS? What am I losing by replacing Nuxt Font Awesome with Vue Font Awesome or with just Font Awesome? How do we reconcile the inclusion of Nuxt Taxonomies in Vue projects it's completely irrelevant to?

It's also intended to permit me to stop overthinking decisions about UI frameworks and CSS libraries. TailwindCSS makes every component very customisable, while DaisyUI provides a solid foundation for making those customisations. TNT, I thought, would be a strong starting point for any of my projects, whether it be a simple blogging website or a rich application dashboard. And honestly it's well on its way. But it's Nuxt dependent, and not all of my Vue projects will be Nuxt ones. At least I never intended for that to be the case, and now that I've reviewed how I might integrate a Vue or Nuxt frontend with a Rails backend... I don't think it can be. So, I need a new Vue project to play around with. For that, I'm going to make a start on Dynamite CMS, a sort of cousing to my TNT project - it's a content management system intended to work in particular with content websites created using TNT.
