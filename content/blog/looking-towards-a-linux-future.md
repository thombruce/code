So, my current machine is in a bit of a state. It's a MacBook Pro 13-inch 2017, and one day the screen just... stopped behaving. I think it's a damaged component, apparently quite common. It can happen as the ribbon cable connecting the screen to the body of the laptop is worn out from opening and closing the machine. This isn't specifically a MacBook problem, but a modern laptop one in general as they try to fit these cables into more snug bodies, resulting in this vulnerability to wear and tear. Regardless, this is a MacBook which means it is also prohibitively expensive to repair or replace. And I did not expect to see a fault like this develop in the amount of time I've had it. My older MacBook Air, now used mainly by my partner, is still chugging on. It's seen a ding or two (my partner is clumsier than I am, she hopefully won't mind me saying), but there are no apparent faults with the hardware. The truth is though that I have specifically chosen Apple machines because it is the easy choice; they're expensive but they work together beautifully. At least they did until my latest machine, _the very machine I'm writing this on_, developed a series of issues. I'm also, despite the fact that Apple hardware does work together seamlessly and beautifully, turned off by the proprietary nature of all of Apple's products. One starts to feel locked in. I want a machine I can tinker with more, one that I can more aggressively personalise and customise. And I want it to cost less; if it breaks and needs repaired or replaced, I don't want to have to spend another small fortune. So, I'm beginning to consider my move to Linux...

Laptop: [Huawei MateBook 13.9 Inch Touchscreen Ultrabook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HUAWEI-MateBook-13-9-Inch-Touchscreen-Ultrabook/dp/B088HX5WMS/ref=psdc_429886031_t4_B08PT6VSGK)
The specs on this thing for the pricetag are insane! Are we sure this is the real deal?

Distro: Debian vs RedHat - I think other distros exist but Ubuntu is Debian and Fedora is RedHat... I'm very interested in Fedora... and whatever GNOME is, though I think that might be on Ubuntu too???

OS: Ubuntu vs Fedora - Consider other options.

Desktop Environment: GNOME - Looks like both Ubuntu and Fedora use this. Also OpenSUSE, though it isn't an OS I've yet looked at - seems too plain for my liking.

Then it's a question of how software is installed...

On MacOS, I use Homebrew with the `brew install` command - on Ubuntu it would be `apt`, on Fedora `yum`. Both, I think, can install Snap if we want that... I think it's kinda like Linux's app store??? I rarely use Apple's - not sure I'd use Linux's, although... it does have advantages, apparently like app isolation: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/a364ii/proscons_of_snap_vs_apt/
